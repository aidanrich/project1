## Description

- What was our motivation? Ever wonder how many people have the game you are playing? How about how many people are playing it right now? What about if there is a book related to the video game you love to play so much? Well that was the motivation for this application. 
- Why did we build this project? We built this project to better search for games we like to play by genre and platform. Plus the added bonus of knowing whether or not a book has been made about the game. 
- What problem does it solve? This page allows users to find games based on genre and platform, also if your the type that likes to read alot it will tell you if your favorite game has a book that you could check out from your local library. 
- What did we learn? Taking on this project we learned alot about how a page should be formatted, how to use a different framework other than bootstrap and how to work collectively as a team to accomplish the task at hand.
